    "## Introduction to Python 01\n",

    "### Data Types\n",
    "All programming languages classify data into types. Understanding the differences between these data types will make programming MUCH easier.\n",
    " - **Integer**: Just like in arithmetic, integers are pretty much any number without a decimal point.\n",
    " - **Float**: Short for \"floating-point number\". Floats are pretty much any number WITH a decimal point.\n",
    " - **String**: Short for \"a string of characters\". Strings are any kind of text.\n",
    " - **Boolean**: Named after the mathematician George Boole, Boolean values are either True or False.\n",
    " - **List**: This is a list of values. Lists may only contain one type of data (you can have a list of integers, but not a list with a mix of integers and strings).\n",
    " - **Tuple**: This is a collection of values. It's like a list, but it can contain different data types, and it cannot be altered once created.\n",
    " - **None**: This signifies a missing value. It's equivalent to NULL in databases."

    "**Functions** are pieces of code that are \"saved\" and can be re-run whenever you need to. They help to organize your code so that you don't have to re-write the same thing over and over again. They can also be used for some advanced techniques such as recursion. You can create a function using the **`def`** keyword. You may also see the **`lambda`** keyword used to create small one-line functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a function in your code, we say that you **call** the function. To call a function, place a pair of parentheses after the function name. Functions can take values as input. Those values are called **parameters**, or **arguments**. When you provide a value to the function, we say that you **pass** a value to the function. In general, functions are only allowed to work with data that are passed in. To pass a parameter into a function, place it in the parentheses. There are rules surrounding what values you can pass and when, but it's easiest to learn these rules by imitating other peoples' code."

That means that we will be using more data types than just the integers, strings, booleans, etc. that we covered earlier.\n",

These packages are all interrelated, so it can be hard to figure out which ones you need. Don't worry too much about the details right now. As you gain more experience, you will understand when to use what package. To use a package or module, you need to **import** it."
